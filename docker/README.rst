Crimson Forge Docker
====================

A ``Dockerfile`` is included to build a container image that is ready to run Crimson Forge. Ubuntu 20.04 is used as the
base image for the environment. The Crimson Forge dependencies are installed system wide using pip and a
requirements.txt file generated by Pipenv. This allows the user to run the Crimson Forge tools, without needing to enter
the ``pipenv shell`` environment.

Usage
-----

#. Build the docker container image

   * ``docker build -t crimson-forge -f . ..``

#. Run a command within the docker container

   * Start an interactive Bash shell

     * ``docker run -it -w /crimson-forge --rm crimson-forge bash``

   * Run the main `crimson-forge` script

     * ``docker run -it -w /crimson-forge --rm crimson-forge ./crimson-forge``

Optionally mount the current directory from the host as a volume in the container: ``docker run -v $(pwd):/data:Z ...``
